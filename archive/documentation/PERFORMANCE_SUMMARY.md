# Video Conference Performance Summary

## Current Status (Iteration 2)

### ✅ Achieved
- **Bandwidth Compliance**: Successfully limited to 1.2 Mbps (72-88% usage)
- **Low Latency**: 1-5ms average (EXCELLENT)
- **Stable Connection**: Jitter < 10ms

### ❌ Issues Remaining  
- **Extreme Packet Loss**: 87-99% video frames lost with 3+ users
- **Poor Video FPS**: 0.2-7 FPS with multiple users (target: 20+)
- **Audio Loss**: 42-83% audio packets lost

## Root Cause Analysis

The packet loss isn't from network issues but from our bandwidth limiting strategy:
1. We're correctly limiting total bandwidth to 1.2 Mbps
2. But we're dropping too many frames at the sender
3. The test shows we need ~10KB per frame but only have budget for 1-2 frames/sec

## Solution Requirements

For 4 users at 250 kbps each:
- **Audio**: 16 kbps × 4 = 64 kbps (protected)
- **Video**: 936 kbps remaining ÷ 4 users = 234 kbps each
- At 3KB per frame (160×120 JPEG): Can sustain ~10 FPS
- Need extreme compression: 1KB frames or less

## Final Optimization Strategy

### 1. Ultra-Compressed Video
- Use WebP instead of JPEG (50% smaller)
- Reduce to 80×60 resolution for 4+ users
- Target 500 bytes per frame
- Achievable: 15-20 FPS at target bandwidth

### 2. Smart Frame Distribution
- Don't relay every frame to every user
- Round-robin frame distribution
- Each user sees different frames but maintains motion

### 3. Audio Priority
- Always send audio (never drop)
- Pre-allocate 20% bandwidth for audio
- Use Opus codec simulation (better than raw PCM)

## Expected Final KPIs

With optimizations:
- **Latency**: < 50ms ✅
- **Audio Loss**: < 5% ✅  
- **Video FPS**: 15-20 ✅
- **Bandwidth**: < 1.2 Mbps ✅
- **User Capacity**: 4-6 users ✅

## Conclusion

The system works within VPS constraints but needs:
1. Better video compression (WebP, tiny resolution)
2. Smarter frame distribution (not all-to-all)
3. Protected audio channel

Current implementation proves the bandwidth limiting works. Next step would be implementing the compression optimizations to achieve acceptable video quality within the 1.2 Mbps limit.
